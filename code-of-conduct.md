title: Code of Conduct of the International Federation of Liberal Youth
---

# Purpose
The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) is committed to ensuring a safe, equitable, and inclusive environment and promoting equal and democratic engagement in all of IFLRY's entities and events. IFLRY is a democratic institution that values open and vigorous discussion of issues concerning the liberal movement. This code of conduct is not intended to restrict free and open debate, but rather is concerned with preventing unacceptable behaviour. For this reason, we do not allow any behaviour, whether offline or online, which can hinder full participation or harm anyone who works or participates in the organization with specific reference to discrimination, sexual or emotional harassment, bullying, prejudice, exclusion, or violence.

# Applicability
This Code of Conduct shall apply to everyone participating in any offline or online activity organized or sponsored by IFLRY. It shall also apply to the employees and representatives of the organization at IFLRY activities and in the workplace as well as when representing IFLRY externally.

The Code of Conduct is not legal or prescriptive in nature. It supplements and does not affect the application of other relevant policies, regulations, rules, and laws, including laws regulating the premises in which the IFLRY event takes place and any applicable policies by other organizations. The code is a minimum standard and must therefore be followed, even if local legislation sets a lower standard.

# Expected Behaviour
IFLRY expects everyone in the workplace and all participants in IFLRY affiliated activities, events, or meetings and the individuals representing IFLRY externally to conduct themselves in the following manner at all times:

(1) Act with integrity and high ethical standards.
(2) Deal fairly with others and treat their views with respect.
(3) Respect the individuality and personal values of individuals.
(4) Recognize and value individual differences.
(5) Avoid behaviour that reflects adversely on IFLRY.
(6) Help maintain a harassment-free environment in IFLRYs meetings, events, and activities; report any suspected harassment, and help ensure non-retaliation to those individuals that report harassment.

# Prohibited Conduct
Any kind of discrimination, violence or threatening behaviour, bullying, degradation, harassment, as well as verbal or nonverbal, physical or non-physical humiliation, and intimidation is prohibited. Any behaviour that disrupts the activity of the event or damages the facilities in which the event is taking place is also prohibited. Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following:

## Discrimination
It is discrimination to make any decision or judgment based on another person’s race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, ancestry, or pregnancy.

Setting age-limits shall not be prohibited in IFLRY if it is done for compelling reasons such as insurance policies or liability. Neither is conducting events, when justifiable, that are limited to participants with a protected characteristic (e.g. a female leadership programme targeting individuals whom identify as female).

## Harassment
Any kind of harassment is prohibited behaviour. Harassment is unwanted behaviour which you find offensive or which makes you feel intimidated or humiliated. You do not need to have previously objected to something for it to be unwanted. It can happen on its own or alongside forms of discrimination. Unwanted behaviour could be, but is not limited to:

 - Unpleasant spoken or written words.
 - Offensive emails,tweets orcomments on social networking sites.
 - Unwanted photography or recording.
 - Degrading physical gestures.
 - Humiliating facial expressions.
 - Degrading jokes.
 - Bullying or stalking.
 - Real or implied threat of physical harm.
 - Physical assault.

## Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment can involve unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It can involve conduct by a person of any gender toward a person of the same or different gender. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images
- Uninvited sexual attention or contact.
- Making derogatory or demeaning comments about someone’s sexual orientation or
gender identity.
- Name-calling or using slurs with a gender/sexual connotation.
- Making sexual comments about appearance,clothing or bodyparts.
- Rating a person’s sexuality or looks
- Repeatedly asking a person for dates or asking for sex.
- Unwelcome touching, including pinching, patting,rubbing or purposefully brushing up against a person.
- Making inappropriate sexual gestures.
- Sharing sexual or lewd anecdotes or jokes.
- Sending sexually suggestive communications in any format.
- Sharing or displaying sexually inappropriate images or videos in any format.
- Attempted or actual sexual assault, including rape.

# Complaint Process
Any general complaints should be directed to the organizational ombudsman. Complaints can also be sent to any member of the IFLRY managing bureau or the head of the IFLRY office, who should involve the ombudsperson in the procedure if possible.2 The procedure of handling general complaints is outlined in the ombudsperson policy.

Prior to the start of any large IFLRY activity, event or meeting, attendees will be informed of this code of conduct and a IFLRY representative, to whom complaints may also be directed to during the specific activity, will be identified for all attendees. The designated person should be the elected organizational ombudsman if present at the event, activity or meeting. If the ombudsman is not present, the task should be assigned to an member of the IFLRY bureau that is present at the event or someone from the IFLRY staff who is present. If this is not possible then the designated person can be assigned amongst the organizing or facilitating team of the activity. It is the responsibility of the organizing and facilitating team to ensure that all the participants are aware of who the designated person is at all events, meetings or activities. If you are subject to what you believe is unacceptable behaviour under this code of conduct or witness such behaviour at an activity, please inform the designated IFLRY representative immediately. If that person is not available, you may inform any other IFLRY staff person, leader, organizer or facilitator present, who will work with the designated person to respond to the complaint.

# Procedure
When an complaint of misconduct is made at a IFLRY activity, event or meeting, at least one IFLRY representative has to, to the best of their abilities and depending on the severity of the situation, take the following measures:

(1) Hold separate conversations with the person who filed the complaint, victim (if different from the complainant), and the perpetrator to clarify what has happened.
(2) When it is clear that a breach of the code of conduct has occurred, a serious conversation with the perpetrator or perpetrators has to be had. During the conversation, the following must be explained:
a. Behaviour exhibited by the perpetrator is completely unacceptable and is contrary to the fundamental values of IFLRY.
b. The behaviour must not be repeated.
(3) If the behaviour still does not end or if the initial breach of the code of conduct was
very severe, the perpetrator or perpetrators can be suspended from the remainder of
the activity.
(4) The person who submitted the complaint must be contacted for a follow-up at least
once after the procedure and measures have been taken.

If needed or requested, IFLRY will help complainants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist complainants experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe for the duration of the activity, event, or meeting. IFLRY will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the complainant is no longer subject to the unacceptable behaviour.

The IFLRY managing bureau is defined as the president, secretary general and treasurer. The head of the IFLRY office is the executive director.

# Consequences
IFLRY takes complaints seriously and may, at its discretion, take other actions that it deems appropriate upon assessing the situation.
IFLRY reserves the right of suspending or terminating the perpetrator’s access to an IFLRY event or refusing registration at future IFLRY events or both. When exercising this right any participation fees are still owed in full by the perpetrator. IFLRY also has the right to demand the non-subsidized sum for participation and IFLRY is not liable for any financial loss that the perpetrator may face due to the suspension or termination of access. A perpetrator that caused IFLRY financial loss (through eg. damaging the facilities in which an event takes place) is fully financially liable for the damage that has been done.

If there is an allegation of criminal wrongdoing, we will strongly advise the complainant to report this to the relevant authority as soon as practicable. In certain instances, we may have a duty to contact the relevant authority directly. IFLRY reserves the right to refer any breach of this code of conduct which breaks the criminal law to the police rather than/as well as dealing with it under this code of conduct.

# Prohibition of Retaliation
IFLRY will not tolerate retaliation against any individual who complains of unacceptable behaviour or provided information in support of a complaint under this code of conduct. It will take every step necessary and appropriate to ensure that retaliation does not occur, and if it is belived that retaliation has occurred, IFLRY will take immediate action to stop the retaliation.

# Confidentiality
IFLRY representatives that are involved in handling a complaint may only disclose any information from the complainant or other involved parties to other people to the extent that it is needed in order to properly handle the situation. The complainant and the persons in question should preferably be consulted before such sharing of information is done. However, disclosing the identity of the complainant and/or victim of prohibited behaviour is only allowed with consent. Confidentiality may be breached only due to serious concerns of safety of individuals or if it is neccessary due to legal proceedings.
