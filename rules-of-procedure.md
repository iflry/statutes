The Individual Members' Group has the right to vote, the right to put forward proposals, and the right to submit amendments to all proposals except where it concerns the Manifesto, Statutes, the Rules of Procedure, or financial documents. For the purpose of defining rights and obligations elsewhere in the rules of procedure, individual members are considered to be members, but not member organizations.

Observer status can be granted by a simple majority vote of the General Assembly and needs to be renewed each year.

All membership applications must be received by the IFLRY office at least two weeks prior to the   start of the General Assembly at which the applicant organization wishes their application to be considered. The IFLRY Office will make sure that all submitted documents will be available to the members at least one week before the start of the General Assembly.

## Termination {#mem-termination}
The members can leave the Federation on the following conditions:

(a) The members of the Federation can resign by themselves.
(b) The members of the Federation can be expelled.

A request for voluntary resignation by a member organization needs to be filed with the Bureau through an official representative of the member organization.

In a case of the General Assembly not confirming the termination request, the membership will terminate at the end of the calendar year. A motion to expel a member can be submitted by the Bureau or two full members and needs to be submitted four weeks prior to the start of the General Assembly.

## Membership Changes {#mem-changes}
If a member organization changes its name, or has merged with another organization which is not a member, the membership is not automatically transferred to the new or differently named entity. Member organizations need to inform the Bureau of any merger with a different organization. The Bureau will decide on the membership status transfer, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.

If no representative is specified in writing, any representative present that was nominated by the member organization shall be entitled to vote on its behalf.

There shall be no limit to the number of delegates from member organizations attending the statutory meeting. Delegates are required to be nominated by their member organization and other attendees are required to register for attending the statutory meeting.

| Number of Members | Votes |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| 1 to 500          |   3   |
| 501 to 1000       |   4   |
| 1001 to 2500      |   5   |
| 2501 to 5000      |   6   |
| 5001 to 10000     |   7   |
| more than 10000   |   8   |

Associate members and the Individual Members Group will receive one vote.

All elections shall take place by secret ballot. All non-election voting shall take place by secret ballot if requested by at least one-third ($\frac{1}{3}$) of the votes present.

## Chairs and Returning Officers {#ga-chairs-ros}
The General Assembly shall elect four chairpersons to chair the sessions. The Chairs shall not be running for other elections. The Chairs will also chair the four Standing Committees, unless otherwise agreed by the GA.

The chair shall appoint three returning officers to administer elections and conduct the ballot. The returning officers shall be persons not standing for elections.

The returning officers shall announce the deadline for nominations for auditors.

## Elections {#ga-elections}
For the Bureau elections those candidacies are valid that were received in writing by the IFLRY office four weeks before the start of the General Assembly.

### President, Secretary General and Treasurer elections {#ga-elections-g3}
The President, the Secretary General and the Treasurer shall be elected by simple majority vote. In the event none of the candidates to each of these positions receives more than 50% of the votes, there will  be additional rounds of voting until the required majority is achieved.

In each of the additional rounds, those who receive the least number of votes, in such a way that even if the votes of those who received less than them could be added to their votes would not change their position, will not participate in the next round.

### Vice President Elections {#ga-elections-vp}
The vice presidents of the organization shall be elected as follows: On each ballot paper the member organizations select the candidates that should be elected as Vice Presidents in such a way that they mark the names of their choice. Each marked candidate will receive one vote. Each member organization must vote on the same number of candidates as the number of positions that must be filled. Voting ballots that do not have the full number of candidates as positions that must be filled will be counted as invalid. The 4 candidates with the most votes are elected in the order of the amount of votes. Only candidates reaching the quorum defined by the following formula are elected: $\frac{1}{\text{the positions available for election} + 1}$ will be eligible for election, meaning i.e. that for four Vice President positions the quorum will be $\frac{1}{4 + 1} = 20\%$ of the total votes possible. For three positions the formula will be $\frac{1}{3 + 1} = 25\%$ of the total votes possible. For two positions the quorum will be $\frac{1}{2 + 1} = 33.33\%$ of the total votes possible. In case of only one vacant position for a round of election, the principle of simple majority shall be used, as is the case with the positions of President, Secretary General and Treasurer as well.  

In case that there are not enough candidates reaching the quorum of the votes, a new round of voting will be held for the remaining place(s). If there are not enough candidates reaching the quorum in the second round of voting, the position will remain vacant until a new call for elections is issued at the next General Assembly. If there are more selections on the ballot paper than the number of the Vice President positions to be elected, the ballot paper is considered invalid. The ballot will also be invalid if it is not possible to identify the names on the ballot. If candidates receive an equal number of votes and it remains unclear which candidates shall be elected, then a second round of voting between these candidates is to be conducted using the above mentioned procedure. Should in this second round of voting, an equal number of votes remain, then lots will be drawn to determine the winner.

### Auditor Elections {#ga-elections-auditor}
For the election of auditors, the ballot can be filled with one or two names. Each name will count   as one vote. It is not possible to give more than one vote to one candidate on each ballot. The two candidates who received the highest number of votes shall be elected Auditors. In case of resignation of an Auditor, the next person on the last Auditor election results list sorted on highest number of votes will replace the vacancy.

### Expulsion and Replacement {#ga-elections-expulsion}
It is the right of a General Assembly, both ordinary and extraordinary, to put the mandate of an elected person in question and to terminate that mandate following a motion of no-confidence with a two-thirds ($\frac{2}{3}$) majority.

Following an expulsion of an elected person it is the right of the General Assembly to immediately elect a replacement. The newly elected Bureau member or auditor will have a period of mandate that expires at the next General Assembly.

In case of a resignation of a Bureau member, the Bureau has the power to appoint a replacement in a non-voting capacity until the next General Assembly, provided there is no meeting of the General Assembly in the following 30 days.

## Agenda {#ga-agenda}

### Urgency Proposals {#ga-urgency-proposals}
Those resolutions shall be dealt with, which, in the opinion of the General Assembly, could not have been proposed before the official deadline due to their urgent nature.
