# Statutes and Rules of Procedure 

The idea is to automate the process of updating the statutes and rules of procedure as much as possible. The current wokflow using GitHub action and pandoc to convert markdown source files into LaTeX pdfs. This can be easily updated so that the output files are uploaded directly to the website.

# Issues 

(1) "All national and student organisations, having legal personality... are welcome to apply for associate or observer membership" is immediately followed by "Organisations that do not fit the above criteria may also apply for associate or observer membership."
  - The first paragraph is redundant 
  - Many full members don't have legal personality (e.g. YL) 
  - There is not a clear indicataion of the criteria for full membership  
(2) The distinction between the "Managing Bureau", the "Extended Bureau" and the "Bureau" is a bit difficult to understand. 
  - Should clarify that "Regional Bureau Members" are bureau members with a regional mandate and not members of regional bureaus.
(3) 8.d requires "a majority of 50% of the votes" 
  - The two interpretations both don't make sense (i.e. maybe this either means a majority of 60% is unnaceptable or it means a majority within a subgroup of 50% is needed so just 25% overall)
(4) A decision to "change the office" requires a "simple majority vote by the Bureau"
  - Firstly, this threshold seems too low. The office could be changed with 3 burea members disagreeing?
  - Secondly, there is some ambiguity: does this refer to staff changes or location change of the office?

(1) "The official languages of the association shall be English, French, and Spanish." but "The mandatory language of the Statutes is German."
  - This isn't the case so long as we are still registered in Belgium 
  - It would be a bit of a pain if the "mandatory" language isn't official because then the GA can't vote on the german wording 
(2) "Decisions are taken by a simple majority of those present and voting, with abstentions being counted as not voting..." but "Decisions are only valid where half of the total votes present at the opening of the meeting are cast. Abstentions shall be included for this purpose."
  - The implication is that abstaining individuals are considred to have not voted but to have cast a vote
  - This weird use of language is very hard to follow  
(3) The fact that the GA has to vote on resignations is very weird 
(4) "Candidate Membership Status" is not defined 
(5) "The President, the Secretary General and Treasurer are elected for the period of two years until the next General Assembly" is quite weird phrasing. There is no period of two years until the next General Assembly because they happen every 6 months 
(6) The role of the auditors in taking mintutes could conflict with their role in providing oversight. No one is able to scrutinise the minute-taking process properly.


##Â Overall Comments 
The stautes should probably have less dependence on the rules of procedure (the other way round is fine) since the idea is the stautes change less often and are more general.
