# Statutes and Rules of Procedure 

The idea is to automate the process of updating the statutes and rules of procedure as much as possible. The current wokflow using GitHub action and pandoc to convert markdown source files into LaTeX pdfs. This can be easily updated so that the output files are uploaded directly to the website.

# Issues 

(1) "All national and student organisations, having legal personality... are welcome to apply for associate or observer membership" is immediately followed by "Organisations that do not fit the above criteria may also apply for associate or observer membership."
  - The first paragraph is redundant 
  - Many full members don't have legal personality (e.g. YL) 
  - There is not a clear indicataion of the criteria for full membership  
(2) The distinction between the "Managing Bureau", the "Extended Bureau" and the "Bureau" is a bit difficult to understand. 
  - Should clarify that "Regional Bureau Members" are bureau members with a regional mandate and not members of regional bureaus.
  - 

(3) 8.d requires "a majority of 50% of the votes" 
  - The two interpretations both don't make sense (i.e. maybe this either means a majority of 60% is unnaceptable or it means a majority within a subgroup of 50% is needed so just 25% overall)
