# Membership

## Rights
All members have the right of information within the federation.
Regional members have the right to appoint a representative without voting rights to the Bureau as Regional Bureau Appointee.

The rights of Members on the decision-making procedures, as well as the nomination procedures within the federation are stipulated in the Rules of Procedure.

## Changes
If a member organisation changes its name, or has merged with another organisation which is not a member, the membership is not automatically transferred to the new or differently named entity. Member organisations need to inform the Bureau of any merger with a different organisation. The Bureau will decide on the membership status transfer, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly. Member organisations need to inform the Bureau of any name change. The Bureau will decide on the membership name change, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.

## Admissions
All membership applications must be received by the IFLRY office at least two weeks prior to the start of the General Assembly at which the applicant organisation wishes their application to be considered. The IFLRY Office will make sure that all submitted documents will be available to the members at least one week before the start of the General Assembly.

All changes to the membership will be added to a Membership Register, which is under the responsibility of the Bureau.

Observer status is valid for two years and needs to be renewed every two years. It will automatically be renewed if the organisation is in good standing, otherwise it should be renewed by the General Assembly.
